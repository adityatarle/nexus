# Product Edit Page - Image Upload Feature Update

## Summary
Successfully updated the product edit page to support image uploads with full functionality for viewing, replacing, and managing product images.

## Changes Made

### 1. **View Updates** (`resources/views/admin/products/edit.blade.php`)

#### Form Enhancements:
- Added `enctype="multipart/form-data"` to support file uploads
- Added image upload section after SKU field

#### Current Image Display:
- **Primary Image**: Shows existing primary image with preview
- **Gallery Images**: Displays all existing gallery images in a grid (up to 5)
- Each gallery image has a remove button (X) to mark for deletion

#### Upload Fields:
- **Primary Image Upload**: Replace existing or add new primary image
  - Validation: JPEG, PNG, WebP formats
  - Max size: 2MB
  - Min dimensions: 400x400px
  - Shows preview of new image when selected

- **Gallery Images Upload**: Add more gallery images (up to 5 total)
  - Multiple file selection supported
  - Same validation rules as primary image
  - Dynamically limits uploads based on existing images
  - Shows preview of all new images with "New" badge

#### JavaScript Features:
1. **Image Preview**: Real-time preview for both primary and gallery images
2. **Client-side Validation**:
   - File size check (2MB max)
   - File type validation (JPEG, PNG, WebP only)
   - Gallery image count limit (max 5 total)
3. **Gallery Image Removal**:
   - Click X button to mark image for deletion
   - Visual feedback (grayscale + opacity)
   - Stores removed image indices in hidden field
   - Button changes to checkmark when marked
4. **Price Calculation Display**: Shows discount percentages for dealer pricing

### 2. **Controller Updates** (`app/Http/Controllers/Admin/ProductController.php`)

#### `update()` Method Enhancements:
```php
- Added image validation rules
- Handle primary image replacement with old image deletion
- Handle gallery image removal (via removed_gallery_images field)
- Handle new gallery image uploads
- Merge existing and new gallery images (max 5)
- Auto-calculate dealer_discount_percentage
- Proper error handling with try-catch
```

#### `destroy()` Method Enhancements:

- Delete all gallery image files when product is deleted
- Proper error handling with try-catch
```

### 3. **Image Management Logic**

#### Primary Image:
- If exists: Shows current image with option to replace
- If new image uploaded: Deletes old image, uploads new one
- If product deleted: Removes image file from storage

#### Gallery Images:
- Displays all existing images (max 5)
- Remove functionality marks images for deletion
- On update: Deletes marked images from storage
- New images are uploaded and merged with remaining images
- Total gallery images capped at 5

### 4. **User Experience Features**

- New images tagged with "New" badge
- Removed images shown with grayscale + opacity
- Real-time preview for uploaded images

#### Validation Feedback:
- Client-side alerts for invalid files
- Server-side validation with error messages
- Clear file requirements displayed

#### Smart Constraints:
- Prevents uploading more than 5 gallery images total
- Shows remaining upload slots
- Validates individual file sizes and types

## Technical Details

### File Storage:
- **Storage Disk**: `public` (configurable to `s3`)
- **Primary Images**: `storage/products/primary_images/`
- **Gallery Images**: `storage/products/gallery_images/`
- **Naming**: UUID-based filenames for uniqueness

### Database Updates:
- Uses existing migration: `2025_10_29_add_images_to_agriculture_products.php`
- Primary image stored as string path
- Gallery images stored as JSON array

### Validation Rules:
```php
'primary_image' => 'nullable|image|mimes:jpeg,jpg,png,webp|max:2048',
'gallery_images.*' => 'nullable|image|mimes:jpeg,jpg,png,webp|max:2048'
```

### Dependencies:
- **FileUploadService**: Handles secure file uploads and deletions
- **Storage Facade**: Laravel's file storage system
- **Bootstrap 5**: For styling and layout
- **Font Awesome**: For icons

Example usage:
```blade
<!-- Primary Image -->
@if($product->primary_image)
    <img src="{{ asset('storage/' . $product->primary_image) }}" 
         alt="{{ $product->name }}">
@endif

<!-- Gallery Images -->
@if($product->gallery_images)
    @foreach($product->gallery_images as $image)
        <img src="{{ asset('storage/' . $image) }}" 
             alt="{{ $product->name }}">
    @endforeach
@endif
```
