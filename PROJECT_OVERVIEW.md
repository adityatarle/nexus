## 💰 Dual Pricing System

### Implementation
Every product has two price fields:

2. **Dealer Price** (`dealer_price` and `dealer_sale_price`)

### Logic
- **Customers see:** Retail prices only
- **Approved Dealers see:** Dealer prices with discount percentage
- **Unapproved Dealers see:** Retail prices until approved
- **Product pages automatically display correct pricing based on logged-in user role**

### Database Fields
```php
// In agriculture_products table
- price (retail regular price)
- sale_price (retail sale price)
- dealer_price (wholesale regular price)
- dealer_sale_price (wholesale sale price)
- dealer_min_quantity (minimum quantity for dealers)
- dealer_discount_percentage (auto-calculated)
```
