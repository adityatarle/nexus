## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Minor Issues

### 1. Home Page Cleanup Needed
**File:** `resources/views/home.blade.php`

**Issue:** Leftover static HTML fragments between dynamic sections

**Quick Fix:**
Open the file and look for lines around 158-479. You'll see static product cards. These can be safely deleted since the dynamic section using `@forelse($bestSellers as $product)` already shows products.

**Not urgent** - The dynamic sections work fine, this is just cleanup.

### 2. Cart Offcanvas Shows Static Data
**File:** `resources/views/layouts/partials/header.blade.php` (lines 90-131)

**Issue:** The cart sidebar shows demo products instead of real cart items

**Quick Fix (Optional):**
Replace the static `<li>` items with:
```blade
@php
    $cart = Session::get('cart', []);
@endphp
@forelse($cart as $id => $item)
<li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between lh-sm">
    <div>
        <h6 class="my-0">{{ $item['name'] }}</h6>
        <small class="text-body-secondary">Qty: {{ $item['quantity'] }}</small>
    </div>
    <span class="text-body-secondary">‚Çπ{{ number_format($item['price'] * $item['quantity'], 2) }}</span>
</li>
@empty
<li class="list-group-item">Your cart is empty</li>
@endforelse
```
