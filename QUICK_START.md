## üìä Understanding the Dual Pricing System

### How it Works

**For Customers:**
- See only retail prices
- Example: Product shows ‚Çπ1000

**For Dealers (Before Approval):**
- See only retail prices
- Message: "Register as dealer for wholesale prices"

**For Dealers (After Approval):**
- See dealer prices with discount badges
- Example: ~~‚Çπ1000~~ **‚Çπ750** (25% OFF)
- Can place bulk orders

### Setting Up Dual Pricing

When adding a product:
1. **Price:** ‚Çπ1000 (what customers pay)
2. **Sale Price:** ‚Çπ900 (optional customer discount)
3. **Dealer Price:** ‚Çπ750 (what dealers pay)
4. **Dealer Sale Price:** ‚Çπ700 (optional dealer discount)

The system automatically:
- Calculates discount percentages
- Shows appropriate prices based on user role
- Applies correct pricing in cart and checkout
- Displays on invoices correctly
