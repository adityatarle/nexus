## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### Before Going Live
1. **MUST** run the database migration to add indexes
2. **MUST** configure production .env file
3. **MUST** switch from SQLite to MySQL/PostgreSQL
4. **MUST** install SSL certificate
5. **MUST** test all functionality thoroughly

### After Going Live
1. Monitor error logs daily (storage/logs/laravel.log)
2. Check performance metrics
3. Verify emails are sending
4. Monitor rate limiting effectiveness
5. Test backup restoration
6. Review security logs

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Rate Limiting Blocks Legitimate Users
```bash
# Adjust rates in routes/web.php and routes/admin.php
# Example: Change from throttle:5,1 to throttle:10,1
```

### If Migration Fails
```bash
# Check for existing indexes first
php artisan db:show-indexes

# If conflicts, modify migration file
# Remove conflicting index names
```

### If File Uploads Fail
```bash
# Check storage permissions
chmod -R 775 storage
chown -R www-data:www-data storage

# Check upload limits in php.ini
upload_max_filesize = 10M
post_max_size = 10M
```
