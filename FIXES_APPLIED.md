### 2. **Dynamic Home Page** ‚úÖ FIXED

### 3. **Sidebar & Layout Issues** (Requires Additional Check)

**Potential causes:**
- CSS conflicts with Bootstrap 5
- Missing responsive classes
- Sidebar toggle JavaScript not working

**Quick Fixes to Try:**

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
3. **Verify Bootstrap JS is loading**

**Additional CSS fix needed:**
Add this to your layout if sidebar is expanding:

```css
/* In layouts/app.blade.php or admin/layout.blade.php */
<style>
.sidebar {
    position: fixed;
    width: 250px;
    height: 100vh;
    overflow-y: auto;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .sidebar {
        transform: translateX(-100%);
        transition: transform 0.3s ease;
    }
    .sidebar.show {
        transform: translateX(0);
    }
}
</style>
```

### 4. **Cart & Wishlist Functionality** (Already Implemented)

**Existing Implementation:**
- Cart routes: ‚úÖ Already defined in `routes/web.php`
- Cart controller: ‚úÖ `AgricultureCartController.php` exists
- Cart views: ‚úÖ `resources/views/agriculture/cart/index.blade.php`

**Routes available:**
```php
GET  /cart                  - View cart
POST /cart/add             - Add to cart
PATCH /cart/update         - Update quantity
DELETE /cart/remove        - Remove item
DELETE /cart/clear         - Clear cart
```

**If cart not working, check:**

1. **Session is enabled** in `.env`:
   ```
   SESSION_DRIVER=file
   ```

2. **Run this command:**
   ```bash
   php artisan session:table
   php artisan migrate
   ```

3. **Clear cache:**
   ```bash
   php artisan cache:clear
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan view:clear
   ```

4. **Check if cart button has correct form:**
   ```html
   <form action="{{ route('agriculture.cart.add') }}" method="POST">
       @csrf
       <input type="hidden" name="product_id" value="{{ $product->id }}">
       <input type="hidden" name="quantity" value="1">
       <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Add to Cart</button>
   </form>
   ```

## üéØ Testing the Fixes:

### Test Dual Pricing:
1. Login as admin: `/admin/login`

5. View product as customer (retail price shows)
6. View as approved dealer (dealer price shows)

### Test Dynamic Home:
1. Visit homepage: `/`
2. You should see real products from your database
3. Categories should show actual count
4. Featured products section populated with real data

### Test Cart:
1. Go to any product page
2. Click "Add to Cart"
3. Should redirect to `/cart`
4. Cart icon should show count

```

### 2. **Add Products with Dual Pricing:**

- Example:
  - Product: Tractor
  - Retail Price: ‚Çπ100,000
  - Dealer Price: ‚Çπ75,000
  - Stock: 10

### 3. **Create Test Accounts:**
- Customer: Register at `/auth/register` (role: customer)
- Dealer: Register at `/auth/register` (role: dealer), then fill dealer registration form

### 4. **Check Browser Console:**
- Press F12 in browser
- Look for JavaScript errors in Console tab
- Look for failed network requests in Network tab
